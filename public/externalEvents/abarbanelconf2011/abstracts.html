Title: Maximum-principle-satisfying and positivity-preserving high order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes for conservation laws<br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
<br>
We construct uniformly high order accurate discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) and weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite volume
(FV) schemes satisfying a strict maximum principle for scalar
conservation laws and passive convection in incompressible flows, and
positivity preserving for density and pressure for compressible Euler
equations.  A general framework (for arbitrary order of accuracy) is
established to construct a limiter for the DG or FV method with first
order Euler forward time discretization solving one dimensional scalar
conservation laws.  Strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time
discretizations will keep the maximum principle and make the scheme
uniformly high order in space and time.  One remarkable property of
this approach is that it is straightforward to extend the method to
two and higher dimensions.  The same limiter can be shown to preserve
the maximum principle for the DG or FV scheme solving two-dimensional
incompressible Euler equations in the vorticity stream-function
formulation, or any passive convection equation with an incompressible
velocity field.  A suitable generalization results in a high order DG
or FV scheme satisfying positivity preserving property for density and
pressure for compressible Euler equations.  Numerical tests
demonstrating the good performance of the scheme will be reported.

Title: Implementation of non local boundary condtions in the equations
of the atmosphere and the oceans.<br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
<br>
It has been known for a long time that the inviscid equations
of the atmosphere and the oceans, the so-called primitive equations,
necessitate nonlocal boundary conditions, unlike the Euler equations to
which they relate.
Description and implementation of appropriate boundary conditions raise
a number of theoretical and numerical difficulties which we will
describe and review in this lecture.</a> </p>

Title: Quasi-Lacunae of Maxwellâ€™s Equations.<br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
<br>
Classical lacunae (in the sense of Petrowsky) in the solutions of
hyperbolic differential equations and systems are a manifestation of the
Huygens' principle. If the source terms are compactly supported in space
and time, then, at any finite location in space, the solution becomes
identically zero after a finite interval of time. In other words, the
propagating waves have sharp aft fronts. For Maxwell's equations though,
even if the currents that drive the field are compactly supported in
time, they may still lead to the accumulation of charges. In that case,
the solution won't have the lacunae per se. We show, however, that the
notion of classical lacunae can be generalized, and that even when the
steady-state charges are present, the waves still have sharp aft fronts.
Yet behind those aft fronts, there is a non-zero electrostatic solution
rather than identical zero. In this case, we refer to quasi-lacunae as
opposed to conventional lacunae.

Quasi-lacunae of Maxwellâ€™s equations can be efficiently exploited in the
numerical context. Indeed, the performance of many well-known methods
used for the treatment of outer boundaries in computational
electromagnetism may deteriorate over long time intervals. The methods
found susceptible to this undesirable phenomenon include various
artificial boundary conditions and perfectly matched layers. We propose
a universal algorithm for correcting this problem. It relies on
quasi-lacunae and the Huygensâ€™ principle, and guarantees a temporally
uniform error bound regardless of either why the deterioration has
originally occurred, or how it actually manifested itself.

Title: Interaction Dynamics of Singular Wave Fronts Computed by Particle Methods <br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
<br>
Some of the most impressive singular wave fronts seen in Nature are the
transbasin oceanic internal waves, which may be observed from a space
shuttle, as they propagate and interact with each other. The
characteristic feature of these strongly nonlinear waves is that they
reconnect whenever any two of them collide transversely. The dynamics of
these internal wave fronts is governed by the so-called EPDiff equation,
which, in particular, coincides with the dispersionless case of the
Camassa-Holm (CH) equation for shallow water in one- and two-dimensions.

Typical weak solutions of the EPDiff equation are contact
discontinuities that carry momentum so that wavefront interactions
represent collisions in which momentum is exchanged. The equation admits
solutions that are nonlinear superpositions of traveling waves and
troughs that have a discontinuity in the first derivative at their peaks
and therefore are called peakons. Capturing these solutions numerically
is a challenging task especially when a peakon-antipeakon interaction
needs to be resolved.

In this talk, I will present a particle method for the numerical
simulation and investigation of solitary wave structures of the EPDiff
equation in one and two dimensions. I will show that the discretization
of the EPDiff by means of the particle method preserves the basic
Hamiltonian, the weak and variational structure of the original problem,
and respects the conservation laws associated with symmetry under the
Euclidean group. I will also present a convergence analysis of the
proposed particle method in 1-D.

Finally, I will demonstrate the performance of the particle methods on a
number of numerical examples in both one and two dimensions. The
numerical results illustrate that the particle method has superior
features and represent huge computational savings when the initial data
of interest lies on a submanifold. The method can also be effectively
implemented in straightforward fashion in a parallel computing
environment for arbitrary initial data.</a> </p>

Title: THE NARROW ESCAPE PROBLEM<br>
<br>
Abstract:
The narrow escape problem in diffusion theory, which goes back to Lord Rayleigh, is to calculate the mean first passage time, also called the narrow escape time (NET), of a Brownian particle to a small absorbing window on the otherwise reflecting boundary of a bounded domain. The renewed interest in the NET problem is due to its relevance in molecular biology and biophysics. The small window often represents a small target on a cellular membrane, such as a protein channel, which is a target for ions, a receptor for neurotransmitter molecules in a neuronal synapse, a narrow neck in the neuronal spine, which is a target for calcium ions, and so on. The leading order singularity of the Neumann function for a regular domain strongly depends on the geometric properties of the boundary. It can give a smaller contribution than the regular part to the absorption flux through the small window when it is located near a boundary cusp. We find the dependence of the absorption flux on the geometric properties of the domain and thus reveal geometrical features that can modulate the flux. This indicates a possible way to physiologically code information.&nbsp; </p>

Title: Mathematical Models of Leukemia, Cancer Stem Cells, and Drug Resistance<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood that is characterized by an abnormal
production of white blood cells.   Traditional approaches for treating
leukemia combine chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and bone marrow (or stem
cell) transplants.  The treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
was revolutionized over the past decade with the introduction of new
molecular-targeted drugs.  Unfortunately, these drugs keep many patients
in remission but do not cure the disease.

In this talk we will also discuss our recent work on mathematical models
of cancer stem cells and their role in developing drug resistance.  When
combined with clinical and experimental data, our mathematical analysis
of drug resistance provides new insights on how to approach treating
CML.  This is a joint work with Peter Kim, Cristian Tomasetti, and Peter
Lee.</a> </p>

Title: Higher order differencing of some second order hyperbolic systems<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
Leapfrog time differencing results in high order accuracy for a class
of symmetric hyperbolic systems. We show how coefficients depending
smoothly on the space variables is compatible with this approach and with
a minimal stencil for the space discretization.
    The order of accuracy survives low regularity of the solution caused
by low regularity initial data. For some examples of nonsmooth
coefficients, some improvement in acuracy can be recovered by careful
space discretization.

Title: The discrete biharmonic equation- optimal convergence in one dimension.
<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
A fourth-order compact scheme for the one-dimensional biharmonic
problem has recently been used as a primary building block in discrete
approximations to the
two-dimensional biharmonic operator. In this talk it
is analyzed in detail, taking into account the effect of the boundary
points.
The elliptic property of (sharp) coercivity is verified for the
discrete operator; its interpretation in terms of stability
of the scheme leads (by an energy method) to a proof of convergence
of the discrete solution to the continuous one.
However, due to the low order of the truncation error near the
boundary, this proof yields a non-optimal rate of
convergence.
Using a matrix representation of the discrete
biharmonic operator and studying carefully its
spectral properties, optimal (fourth-order) convergence is established.

Title: Rich quasi-linear systems which are not in the evolution form.
<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
The aim of this talk is to consider quasi-linear systems of conservation
laws which are not in the form of evolution equations. We propose a new,
more general, condition of Richness for such a
system and prove that the blow up analysis along characteristic curves can
be performed for it in an analogous manner. This opens a possibility to use
this ansatz not only for Hydro-dynamics but also for geometric problems.

Title: Absorbing layer methods for the low-speed compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
While the development of perfectly matched layer (PML) methods have
had a profound impact on the ability to accurately model complex
linear wave problems in open domains, the general extension of such
techniques to nonlinear wave problems remains elusive.

In this talk we show how taking a step back and considering the BGK
approximation for Boltzmann equation suggests a path that allows the
development of PML style layers for the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. While we shall focus on the low-speed case, it appears that
similar ideas are applicable to the transonic case with minor changes.

We shall discuss the different elements of these developments and
illustrate the performance of the absorbing layers for a number of
preliminary benchmarks.

This work is done in collaboration with Z. Gao (Ocean University of
China) and T. Warburton (Rice University).

Title: The development and state of the art of strong stability preserving methods. <br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
Strong stability preserving time discretizations were developed for use with total variation 
diminishing spatial discretizations, and proven useful for the time evolution of ordinary differential 
equations resulting from a method-of-lines discretization of hyperbolic PDEs. In this talk, 
I describe the historical development of strong stability preserving methods, and the current state 
of the art in this field.

Title: Remarks on CFL conditions and on Nonlinear Stability
<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
In the first part, some precise CFL conditions will be explicitly
computed.

In the second part, an improved convergence theory for finite
difference schemes for quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic systems will
be described. The theory requires only the same smoothness needed
for the existence theory of the PDEs themselves. Most of the results in this part 
will appear in the forthcoming PhD thesis of Liat Even-Dar Mandel.

Title: Extrapolation Models for Acceleration and Extension
<br>
<br>
Abstract: <br>
<br>
We discuss the role of linear models for two extrapolation problems.
The first is the extrapolation to the limit of infinite series, i.e.
convergence acceleration. The second is an extension problem: Given
function values on a domain D, possibly with noise, we would
like to extend the function to a larger domain.
In addition to smoothness at the boundary of D, the extension on
should also resemble behavioral trends of the
function on D, such as growth and decay or even oscillations. In
both problems we discuss the univariate and the bivariate cases, and
emphasize the role of linear models with varying coefficients.
